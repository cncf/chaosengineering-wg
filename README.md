# Chaos Engineering Working Group üí•‚öôÔ∏èüß∞

Welcome to the Chaos Engineering Working Group. The intent of this working group is to explore chaos engineering in the cloud-native space and generate
information for organizations to get started and/or improve their resilience engineering practice. The learnings are being crystallized in a whitepaper. 

The working group consists of members from different CNCF TAGs, chaos engineering projects and end-users. Feel free to add yourself as an [interested party](./interested-parties.md)
and contribute towards this effort! 


## Useful Artifacts

- [Workgroup Charter](./charter.md) 

  - Describes the goals, non-goals, working model and expected outcome for this working group. 
 
- [Glossary of chaos engineering terminology](./glossary.md) 

  - A live document that collates terminologies in the chaos engineering world, that are sorted, not alphabetically, but in a conceptual sequence that one
    is likely to encounter when beginning the practice of chaos. Effort is being made to provide not just standard definitions, but some additional context that users might
    find meaningful.  

    Please create a PR to update the current definitions or add new ones! 

- [Whitepaper Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10l262yuX_Zj8ht1pqKlSZAk4-KxY1tc-PaVmbqIsoDw/edit) (in-progress)

## User Interviews

One of the the Working Group's agenda items is to invite chaos engineering practitioners in the community and learn from their experiences. Ideally these
would include end-user viewpoints, that of vendors/projects in this space and those from other allied disciplines, such as Observability, for example. 
The user presentations/discussions are expected to be mostly tool/platform-neutral in nature and focus more on the practice, challenges and philosophy 
around chaos engineering. 

Here is a very minimal [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lX-_c4v-V1ZyZoXZwdbgRxHrbT6WgwOjhjPh00YWyNE/edit#slide=id.gec157007aa_0_141) template that 
presenters can use to fill their information into OR used as cues for discussion during such meetings. 

The notes from such discussions are available at [user-interviews](./user-interviews).

If you are a SRE/DevOps engineer/manager practicing chaos engineering in your organization OR a contributor/maintainer of a chaos project, we'd love to hear your 
story.
