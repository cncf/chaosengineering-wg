# Chaos Engineering Working Group üí•‚öôÔ∏èüß∞

Welcome to the Chaos Engineering Working Group. The intent of this working group is to explore chaos engineering in the cloud-native space and generate
information for organizations to get started and/or improve their resilience engineering practice. 

The working group consists of members from different CNCF TAGs, chaos engineering projects and ens-users.

The results of the work put in by this group will be placed in a whitepaper.
